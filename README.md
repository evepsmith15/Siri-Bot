# Liri-Bot
Homework 8

Liri bot is an app that takes input from the user and then searches the databases for either music bands, songs or movies. It's a smaller version of already established websites that can do all that is listed but with a smaller code. This only works in the terminal.

The folder is divided has two main javascript files. The key.js is used to grab the information from the package and send it to the main javascript liri.js. Liri.js reads the information and prints it out in the data base with some user input. The random.txt file is read for spotify should liri not find the song requested and defaults to "I want it that way". The API keys are placed in the env.
